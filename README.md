# Bellman_Ford_Pathfinding

Bellman-Ford pathfinding algorithm, made in Unity for BSc Temalabor class in 2019 at Budapest University of Technology and Economics
Define two corner in the Pathfinding scene, and then the algorithm will calculate the value for all nodes in rectangle between the two given corners for the end point. 
If any object follows the value of the nodes, in every step steps to a lower value node, it will reach the end point.
